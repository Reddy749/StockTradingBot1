Stock Trading Bot Deployment
=============================

1. Create a new file called `.env` (in this folder) and add:
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_real_token_here

2. Push this folder to a GitHub repository (e.g., StockTradingBot).

3. Go to https://render.com and create a new Web Service:
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Render will detect `render.yaml` and auto-deploy

4. After deployment, open your bot in Telegram and type /start

You're live! ðŸš€
